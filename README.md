EMPLOYEE HR PORTAL USING HTML
"I have created an HTML project for an employee HR portal. It contains a registration form with fields for name, ID, password, age, role, and joining date. Additionally, there is an employee directory listing all registered employees, as well as pages for contact information and the office location."
